# Memory Management Rules for 32GB RAM System

# Exclude patterns (keep these as they're good practice regardless of RAM)
ignore_patterns:
  - .next/**
  - node_modules/**
  - .git/**
  - *.log

# Memory cleanup triggers (relaxed for high RAM)
cleanup_on:
  - file_count: 25     # More files can be open
  - idle_time: 60      # Longer idle time before cleanup
  - memory_limit: 8GB  # Higher memory limit given your 32GB RAM

# Context management (expanded)
context:
  max_file_size: 20MB  # Can handle larger files
  max_history: 200     # Keep more history
  refresh_interval: 120 # Less frequent refreshes needed

# Performance optimization
optimize:
  lazy_loading: false  # Can load more aggressively with high RAM
  cache_limit: 4GB     # Larger cache size
  parallel_ops: 8      # More parallel operations
